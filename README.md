# DocuMind

DocuMind is an AI-powered document question-answering system that uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate responses based on the content of uploaded PDF documents.

## Features

- PDF document ingestion and processing
- Semantic chunking for optimal text splitting
- Vector storage using Qdrant for efficient retrieval
- Hugging Face language model integration (google/gemma-2-27b quantized to fp4)
- Reranking and chain filtering options for improved accuracy
- Session-based chat history management

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/lurchyy/DocuMind
     cd DocuMind
     ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


3. Set up environment variables:
- Get the QDrant URL to your cluster using ```https://qdrant.to/cloud```
- Create a `.env` file in the project root which will contain the QDrant Link.
- Add `QDRANT_URL` variable pointing to the project directory


## Usage

```
python main.py path/to/pdf1.pdf path/to/pdf2.pdf
```
To exit the application, type ```exit``` or ```quit```

## Configuration

Adjust settings in `config.py`:

- Model parameters (embeddings, reranker, language model)
- Retriever settings (use of reranker, chain filter)
- Database and file paths
